# Paradigm Shift
We have built an App to tell the story of **Kalpana Chawla,** the first woman of Indian origin in space. Hers is a story of courage, power and bravity.

The App, made using Flutter, uses liquid animations and timeline display to provide knowledge while keeping things fun and interactive. The app also integrates AR to pay homage to a life well lived.

The data weâ€™ve collected and the research we've done, we'd like to share it with the world. It is not only our goal to spread the word but also to make it fun as we go.

## The app uses liquid animations to keep things interactive and fun.

## Timeline Page
The **launch button** opens up to a Timeline Page which tells the story of Kalpana from her birth in Karnal, to her Education, her getting selected in NASA to her untimely demise in the Columbia Accident.

The best part, all these **containers are clickable with links to external resources** for more information. Like the Columbia incident one opens up to Accident Investigation Report by NASA itself.

## AR Camera
The app also integrates Augmented Reality feature which once fully developed would allow the users to **meetup Kalpana virtually** through their smartphones.

But since under production currently it augments a Black oval through the camera onto the surroundings, representative of the vast space which Kalpana laid her life exploring.

The black dot is also a symbol for: **Stories in the Dark, yet to be explored**
